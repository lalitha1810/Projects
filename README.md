# Personnel Data Projects: 
1. Data Analysis on Beer Recommendation 

With so much of brands in Beer in the market, I have created a Data Analysis project on what Beer is recommended to the user with a simple Dataset available in the form of a .csv file. This project uses the statistical concepts of Euclidean and Manhattan. These are imported from the skylearn metrices of Python. 
Had so much fun in analysing with the Dataset!!!
